<p class="small">

Taught in the Spring term of 2018, this studio invited students to use Art as an intervention strategy for social activism and change. Working with cultural, social, and historical context and framework- students were asked to explore contemporary issues & respond through their medium of choice to create a campaign movement for a social cause. Students created a diverse range of projects that speak to and address <a href="https://cambridge.nuvustudio.com/studios/paper-protests/project-5#tab-portfolio">Gun Violence</a>, Women's Equality, LGBTQ safe spaces, Environmental mitigations, and even a food-positive campaign called <a href="https://cambridge.nuvustudio.com/studios/paper-protests/project-1#tab-portfolio">Eat Ugly.</a>

<p class="small">
In regions where political upheaval causes destruction of ancient relics, giant 3D printers are used as a way to resurrect what was lost. In changing times when confederate statues are entwined in heated debates, new perspectives are shared through augmented reality. There is a resurgence of interest and demand in re-examining something from the past â€” an event, a person, a statue. 

In this studio, students explored the power dynamics of memorialized events/people/places by inverting the top down approach in creating spaces of recognition. Students built their own ideas of memorials that challenge the traditional monuments, shine light on the pulse of the youth, and bridge the gap between the daily reality v. polished fantasy of bygone years.

</h5>
<p>
<p class="small">
The world's old population is growing dramatically. 

As a society, there are many ways to demonstrate how we take care of our aging population. In most cases, programs such as healthcare and special assistance are provided to enhance the quality of life and well-being of senior citizens- however that is not always the case. In this studio, students explored the opportunity to create something special for the aging community.

They took a deep dive into understanding the daily life and hurdles of the aging population and how societies perceive and interact with the elders in their community. Through research and interviews, they learned about encounters and issues that result from aging.

From creating a device for writing that help a former playwright with Parkinson's disease control hand tremors to an assistive standing device, students showcased many innovative projects to the residents at Mt. Pleasant Home in Jamaica Plains, MA.

In 2016, bleaching of coral on the Great Barrier Reef killed half of the reef's coral. When corals begin to dim and glow, it is from their increased fluorescent protein levels triggered from temperature stress. Due to this physiological phenomenon, the reef glows bright fluorescent green before fading out to white. A vibrant home that provided shelter, food, and other resources for millions of species is rapidly disappearing due to our ocean's escalating fever. 

There is still so much to discover and learn from our planet's ocean. It is not complete without the intricate and otherworldly life forms that live within it. In this studio, students brought the 'rainforest of the sea' to the surface through interactive artifacts that help us learn about and protect this rapidly disappearing hub of life. 

Students took a deep dive into the world of corals, fish, mollusks, and many other species and life forms under water. Taking inspiration from this, they created sculptures that communicate and create awareness of human impact & the fragility of the underwater ecosystem.
